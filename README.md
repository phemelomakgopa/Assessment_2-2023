CMPG 212-Assessment 2/ Assessering 2
INHANDIGINGSDATUM/SUBMISSION DATE: 25 Mei / 25 May
Punte/Marks: 100

The purpose of this assessment is to provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate how well you are
able to integrate the concepts that you have learned in the CMPG212 module.
This assessment takes the form of a creative project, which means that you have to identify or define your
own scenario in which you can address a perceived problem or need by developing a C# ASP.NET web
application. The project consists of 1) a project description and, 2) a computer program.
NB: This assessment is to be completed individually. You are not allowed to receive or provide assistance
to another person. Plagiarism of any kind, including copying code from any source, is expressly prohibited.
1. Project description
Write a summary of the basic functionality of your web application and describe the scenario that you have
developed the application for (max. 500 words). This is to give the marker the required background to
assess your project. Submit the summary on eFundi in the assignment text box as well as a .txt file that
you submit along with your project.
2. Computer program
Basic requirements:
- Decide on the scenario of the project.
-Create an ASP.NET Web site. Use C# programming. Include different controls.
- Implement a variety of suitable ASP.NET controls.
- Implement an ASP.NET Calendar control and the DateTime class.
-Use at least 3 web pages in your webpage.
-Make use of cookies and sessions where applicable.
-Include a database with at least 4 fields and 10 records.
-Include database interactions/queries to retrieve and display data, filter data based on user input, update
records, delete records, and add new information to the database.
-Use input validation.
-Finally, use styling and good design principles to enhance your web application.

3. A good idea is to run your project from an external storage medium (eg USB disk) to make sure it will
also be able to run on the marker's computer after downloading it from eFundi.
Submission
Where practical, compress your VS project into a .zip file and upload it to eFundi under this assessment.
However, should your project be too large and/or you encounter any other upload errors, use the eFundi
Drop Box and make it clear in the assessment under “Assignments” that your project was uploaded
there.
In all cases (in addition to your project/files), submit clearly delimited copies of your C# and HTML code
as well as screen shots of your web pages in the assignment on eFundi.
Remember to submit the summary of your web application and scenario along with your code.
