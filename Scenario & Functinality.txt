SCENARIO
The owners of Quantum Mak have approached me to create an online shopping web application for their electronics store. The store offers a wide range of electronics, including smartphones, laptops, audio equipment, and home appliances. The application must be designed to provide customers with a convenient platform to browse and purchase a wide range of electronic products. Customers should be able to add products to their shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and complete their purchase by providing shipping information.

The application aims to cater to tech-savvy individuals and gadget enthusiasts, offering a user-friendly interface and a diverse range of electronics. By creating an online shopping web application, Quantum Mak can provide customers with the convenience of shopping for electronics from the comfort of their homes. It aims to reach a larger customer base and offer a seamless shopping experience. The application aims to cater to customers of all ages and backgrounds.

Key functionalities of the application include browsing product categories and adding products to the shopping cart. The shopping cart allows users to manage selected items, modify quantities, and remove products. The cart is persistent, ensuring a seamless shopping experience even if users leave and return to the website. Real-time price calculations are implemented to provide updated subtotal and total cost information.

The checkout process prompts customers to enter personal information for registration, shipping information, and contact details, with validation ensuring accuracy. A summary of the order is displayed, including item details, quantities, and prices. Secure payment options facilitate safe transactions. After successful checkout, customers receive order confirmation messages and emails.
